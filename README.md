# Unit 06: Server-Side APIs 
=======
# Coin Versus Coin

## Project Description

## API Links
,,,
Current running list for reference (For our group to reference).
https://kanye.rest

## User Story
,,,
As a USER I want to compare the current listing for Etherium  & Bitcoin -
against ONE other random cryptocurrencies. 

Additionally, I would like to see an inspirational quote to keep my spirits high, and prices low. 

## Test Case with Demo
,,,
When I choose to REFRESH the page, Etherium & Bitcoin stay as static elements with the latest data for that specific day, and the third element brings up a random cryptocurrency for comparison. At the bottom of the screen, a quote from the KanyeREST.API appears, and is subject to change as well upon selecting REFRESH.
